An open-source, self-hosted music streaming application developed with Python and Vue.js, focusing on fast performance, beautiful UI, and various device support.

- Since this project is part of my learning process, there may be many areas that need improvement. I have little experience doing backend development with Python. Also, this is my first time using JavaScript and Vue.js.
- As I'm focusing on preparing for the CSAT this year, more time will be dedicated to my studies. Therefore, the application's completion might face delays until at least the end of the year.
