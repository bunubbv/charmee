Tamaya is a fast, lightweight self-hosted music streaming platform that supports various audio formats with simple interface.

Since this project is part of my learning process, there may be many areas that need improvement. I have little experience doing backend development with Python, also this is my first time using JavaScript and Vue.js.

Feedback is always welcome!
